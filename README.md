## Getting Started

Welcome to Security Rent, a "software" created to simulate an "AirBnB" where you will be able to open the door lock with your own celphone!
The project is in progress, but the idea is being developed.


## Idea Structure

The project consist in three steps, where:

- `register`: user will register to rent places
- `deal the rent`: get the request to rent that house, work with API's to get a special token to place in celphone(or card whatever it is just for tests)
- `open the lock`: the token in any tool that might work will be able to open that door.

Meanwhile, the project is being developed, you can check cloning it to your repository to try at home.

> As I said, it is just the idea of the project, so nothing is real and it is just for fun and to try out my habilities.
